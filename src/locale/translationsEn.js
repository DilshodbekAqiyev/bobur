At the end of the 15th century, Movarounnahr was divided into many provinces, which became almost independent, headed by conflicting Timurid princes or wealthy nobles. The struggle for the Movarounnahr throne was in full swing, various political conspiracies were being organized. On top of that, several beks and governors subordinate to Umarshaikh Mirza refused to obey the young ruler (Babur). Some of them support Babur's brothers, some claim independence , others are opponents of Babur, others join their uncles and uncles and come to the point of losing him physically. In the first 2-3 years of Babur's reign, Babur, who repelled the attacks of his uncle and uncle, Sultan Ahmed Mirza, and Sultan Mahmud Khan, implemented important measures such as strengthening his position, improving relations with governors and officials, bringing order to the army, and establishing discipline in state affairs. Babur's initial political goal was to capture the strategically and geographically important Samarkand , the capital of Amir Temur's state , and to preserve and strengthen a strong state centered in Movarunnahr and restore Amir Temur's kingdom.",

Some of the workers flee to Andijan and Akhsi. After that, some of the begs who remained in Andijan turned their backs on Babur and joined his brother Jahangir Mirza . Babur, who was unhappy with Andijan and suffered from economic difficulties , and experienced a serious illness at the same time, decided to leave Samarkand after ruling it for a hundred days . Babur's attempt to recapture Andijan with the support of his uncle Mahmudkhan , governor of Tashkent , was unsuccessful. This failure had a negative impact on Babur's army, and most of the beks and navkars (700-800 people) left Babur. After staying in Khojand for some time, Babur, who remained with his loyal men (200-300), came to Tashkent to meet Mahmud Khan and began to make a plan to recapture Andijan . After a certain period of time, Babur returned to Khojand, and soon after, he captured Margilon and oversaw the capture of Andijan. Finally, after 2 years ( June 1498 ), he regained it.

They sent a letter to the governor of Ferghana , Babur , and invited him to occupy Samarkand. When Babur arrived in Samarkand with his army (240 people) in the late fall of 1500 , the people greeted him and opened the city gates . 600 soldiers left by Shaibani Khan to protect the city will be destroyed. Shaibani Khan retreats to Bukhara. In a short time , Babur's governorship was recognized in all districts of Samarkand, in the cities of Karshi and Guzor , but the city ran out of food supplies and famine began. When Shaibani Khan learned about this, he gathered a lot of strength and started marching to Samarkand again.

    'Capture of Kabul . Coin minted by Babur in Kabul, 1507-1508 Babur warriors, 1520s Babur with his army of 200-300 men crossed the Hissar mountains to Afghanistan and took advantage of the internal conflicts there to capture Ghazni and Kabul. After taking over Kabul, Babur began to build an independent state, organized the army, and established strict internal discipline. Babur treated Kabul and Afghanistan in general as his own country, started construction, beautification, development of trade and agriculture. He established camps such as Bogi Shakhroro , Bogi Jahanoro , Ortabog , Bogi Wafa and Bogi Babur . He made the Bolo Hissar fortress inside the city his residence, renovated it, built new buildings and lived in this fortress with his family. His children Humayun , Gulbadanbegim , Komron and Hindol were born here. Kutlug Nigorkhanim Mirzo Ulugbek, who died in the spring of 1506, will be buried in the Bogi Navrozi built here . Babur was active in Afghanistan not as a conqueror, but as an active ruler who devoted his life to the welfare and prosperity of this country, and worked justly and wisely for its interests. According to his practical activities in Afghanistan, Babur gained a great reputation as a powerful head of state and a victorious general in the whole of Khurasan and Mowarunnahr, and the political life in the region rose to prominence. The fact that Sultan Husayn Boykara specially invited Babur, among all the Timurid rulers, to the consultation meeting in the matter of taking joint measures against the increasing Shaybanite march, is a proof of such a high influence. Babur went to Herat on this offer. Despite the sudden death of Husayn Boykara (1506), he went to Herat and held talks with Timurid rulers. The plans of the Timurid rulers to unite and block the forces of Shaibani Khan will not be realized, and soon they will be defeated one after another and the kingdom will be completely lost. At the beginning of 1507 , Babur began to march to India, but this attempt failed and he returned to the capital Kabul.',
